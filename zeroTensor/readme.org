* Efficient Zero Tensor Benchmarks

These are all derived from a [[So this makes sense as definitely non ZT (other_ is from torch.randn )][master script original posted by Anjali]].

** Usage
This demands multiple builds (or different evironments). Keep to the same configuration. If running on a CUDA enabled system, modify the scripts for better results.
#+begin_src bash
micromamba activate pytorch_ztaddmm
python bench_withZT.py
micromamba activate pytorch_master
python bench_withoutZT.py
python benchComparer.py
#+end_src
